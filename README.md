# R&D
In this project we are using 3 modules.

PART 1
"NOISATION"
For simulating the Medical or RS imaging cameras noise affects.

PART 2
"DENOISATION"
For finding the best filter to approach the orginal image in each noisy situation.

PART 3
"PSNR"
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is a widely used metric in image and video processing to assess the quality of reconstructed or compressed images. It quantifies the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise, providing a measure of how faithfully an image has been preserved or reconstructed . Specifically, PSNR is expressed in decibels (dB) and is computed by comparing the original image to the processed or compressed version.

PSNR is valuable in evaluating the fidelity of images, ensuring that the visual information remains intact despite compression or other transformations. Higher PSNR values indicate better image quality, while lower values suggest a loss of information and increased distortion. It is a crucial tool in the field of signal processing and quality assessment for images and videos.
